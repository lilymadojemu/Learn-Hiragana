Notes:
-Focusing only on HIRAGANA & words only using base HIRAGANA,
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Goals before Nov 23rd:
Behind the Scences Stuff:
- Decide on and Hardcode the material that the user will learn
- Figure out how information will be presented using graphics & images
- Learning Aspect(Focus on reading/Recognition until MVP)

1. Different User Profilese
    - Each profile should have a "customized experience" as noted below
2. Dynamically change information presented based on user's input

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After MVP
3. Text Entry as imagined, if not just have user
install an use a Japanese keyboard
4. Add Listening component
5. Automatically include words based on Frequency in newspaper and every speech
        ^^^ Could be based off a frequency list found online ^^^
6. Audio!!!
'''

Thoughts:
can create a dictionary from textfile, using a very large dict though :(
No direcr try again feature, the incorrecr word will just be added to some bank
keeping track of what words were right and wrong and will output them later 
according to that
No separate review phase (for now)
